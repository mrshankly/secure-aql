# AQL

An SQL-like interface for [AntidoteDB](https://github.com/antidotedb/antidote).

## Installation

AQL can be used through Docker (recommended), or directly through rebar3.

### Docker

To use AQL through Docker simply pull the image from Docker Hub
[here](https://hub.docker.com/r/pedromslopes/aql/). If docker can't 
pull the latest version of the image, do it manually by:

```
    docker pull pedromslopes/aql:<latest-version-available>
```

This image starts an AntidoteDB server 
(uses [this](https://hub.docker.com/r/pedromslopes/antidotedb/) image) on
background and runs an AQL instance of top.
Strictly speaking, AQL and AntidoteDB represent a single system, where AQL communicates
with AntidoteDB via local calls.

This is the recommended way of running AQL, at least for single-client use.

### Rebar3
This project can also be installed "manually" through Rebar3. In order to do so,
clone this repository and checkout this branch:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/pedromslopes/AQL
    $ cd AQL && git checkout master
```

Open a terminal in the project folder (`cd AQL`) and then compile the project:

```
    $ make release
```

Now, to run the client, you may start in shell mode by running one of the following commands:

```
    $ make aqlshell
```
or
```
    $ make shell
```
The first command starts a native AQL shell where you can issue AQL queries to the database. To see
which queries you can use, read the section API bellow.
The second command starts an Erlang shell where you can write native Erlang commands and call
directly exported functions from the modules supported by the AQL application. Use this
shell if you are aware of the AQL internal structure.

Both commands start an HTTP server for communication with AQL in background. The
server listens on the TCP port 3002.

## Getting started

AQL is an SQL-variant, designed to work with AntidoteDB API.

### Shell
AQL provides a shell mode, which is the easiest way to use the
client. In AQL's shell mode (command `make aqlshell`), you'll see a prompt like this:
```
    AQL>
```
Use the prompt to input AQL statements.

### API

The AQL API is pretty straightforward. There is a main module called
`aql` with two methods, the `query` and `read_file`.
The `query` method has two headers:
* `query(Query)` receives a query and outputs the result;
* `query(Query, Transaction)` receives a query and a transaction descriptor and outputs the
final results.

Similarly, the `read_file` supports two headers as well:
* `read_file(Filename)` receives a file name, reads and parses a file with AQL statements and returns the result of applying the statements on the database;
* `read_file(Filename, Transaction)` receives a file name and a transaction descriptor reads and parses a file 

Therefore, exist two ways of performing a query in AQL. For instance, consider a query to show
all existing tables in the database, While using the Erlang shell mode (activated through
the `make shell` command) this query can me submitted as the following:
```Erlang
aql:query("SHOW TABLES").
```
or
```Erlang
aql:query("SHOW TABLES;", TxId).
```
This latter example assumes you started a transaction previously (see next section).
While using the native AQL shell (through the `make aqlshell`), this query is submitted on its raw form, like the following:
```
    AQL> SHOW TABLES;
```

## AQL Docs

AQL supports multiple SQL-like operations such as:
* Data definition
  * CREATE TABLE
* Data manipulation
  * SELECT
  * INSERT
  * UPDATE
  * DELETE
* Admin
  * SHOW TABLES/INDEX
* Transactions
  * BEGIN
  * COMMIT
  * ABORT

AQL supports a limited set of types:
* VARCHAR - common text data type (similar to SQL's VARCHAR)
* INTEGER/INT - common integer data type (similar to SQL's INTEGER)
* BOOLEAN - common boolean
* COUNTER_INT - integer counter, with bounds
(based on AntidoteDB's
[Bounded Counter](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/srds15.pdf))

### CREATE TABLE

Creates a new table. If the table already exists the new table will overwrite it
 (any concurrent conflicts will be resolved with a *Last Writer Wins* CRP).

```SQL
CREATE UPDATE-WINS TABLE Student (
	StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
	Name VARCHAR,
	Age INT DEFAULT 18,
	YearsLeft COUNTER_INT CHECK (YearsLeft > 0),
	Passport_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY UPDATE-WINS REFERENCES Passport(id)
) PARTITION ON (Age);
```

#### Primary keys

The primary key constraint must be specified after the column which is to be
set as the primary key (multiple columns as primary keys are not supported).
Any datatype can be a primary key.

Primary keys only guarantee uniqueness. Although, if two rows with the same 
primary key are inserted (either concurrently or not), both insertions will be
merged, and all columns will also be merged according to its datatypes.

#### Check Constraints

AQL also supports constraints on counters (`counter_int`). Assign numeric bounds
to any `COUNTER_INT` column by:
```SQL
CHECK (column_name [ < | <= | > | >= ] value)
```

Where `column_name` is the column and `value` is the respective bound.

#### Default Values

You can also define a default value for a record (not allowed in primary keys).
Default values are used when no value is specified for a record.

Syntax:
```SQL
column_x data_type DEFAULT value
```

Where `value` is the default value.

#### Foreign Keys

Foreign keys allow users to create custom relations between elements of different
tables. To create a foreign key relation simply add to the column that will be 
the foreign key: `FOREIGN KEY [ UPDATE-WINS | DELETE-WINS ] REFERENCES parentTable(parentColumn) [ ON DELETE CASCADE ]`, 
where `parentTable` is the parent table name (e.g. `Passport`) and `parentColumn` is
the parent column name (e.g. `id`). All foreign keys must point to columns with a 
unique constraint, which is only guaranteed in primary keys.

Additionally you can define a row's behaviour upon a parent deletion through the notation
`ON DELETE CASCADE`, which tells a row to be removed if its parent row is deleted.
The absence of this notation implies that the parent cannot be deleted if one or more rows point to it.

Update-wins (`UPDATE-WINS`) and Delete-wins (`DELETE-WINS`) are conflict resolution policies used
to resolve any referential integrity related conflicts generated by concurrent operations.
Update-wins will revive all rows (deleted) involved in the conflict, while
Delete-wins deletes all involved rows in case of conflict. If none of these policies is specified,
the table assumes strong semantics that preclude parent rows to be deleted concurrently with the
update of child rows.

#### Partitioning

The CREATE TABLE statement allows to partition a table by column, which is most known as horizontal partitioning.
Hence, to partition a table use:
```SQL
PARTITION ON (column_name);
```
, which indicates that the table will split its rows by the column `column_name`.

### SELECT

SELECT is the main read operation in AQL (similar to SQL). The operation issues
a read operation in the database engine (AntidoteDB).
```SQL
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE StudentID = 20;
```

This operation supports conjunctions (`AND`) and disjunctions (`OR`), and parenthesis to group sub-queries.
A sub-query may be a sequence of one or more comparisons on the form:
```SQL
column_name [ = | <> | < | <= | > | >= ] value
```

### INSERT

Inserts new records in a table. If a value with the primary key already exists it
 will be overwritten.
```SQL
INSERT INTO (StudentID, Name, Age, YearsLeft, Passport_id) VALUES (10000, 'John', 'Smith', '24', 'ABC');
```

The table columns may be omitted, in which case all columns will be considered on the insertion.
*Note*: string values must always be between single quotes (`'`).

### UPDATE

Updates an already-existent row on the specified table.

```SQL
UPDATE Student
SET Age = 25
WHERE StudentID = 10000;
```

Updates all rows in table `Students` where `StudentID` has value 1. The update
sets column `Age` to value `25`. All update operations on columns are based on equalities with different expressions depending on the column's datatype:
* *VARCHAR*/*INTEGER*:
  * `Col = val` sets the column `Col` of type `VARCHAR`/`INTEGER` or `INT` to the value `val` specified (`val` must be a number for the integer datatype).
* *COUNTER_INT*:
  * `Col = Col + val` increments the column `Col` of type `COUNTER_INT` by the value `val` specified.
  * `Col = Col - val` decrements the column `Col` of type `COUNTER_INT` by the value `val` specified.
* *BOOLEAN*:
  * `Col = true` sets the boolean column `Col` to `true`.
  * `Col = false` sets the boolean column `Col` to `false`.
  * In both cases, the boolean value to assign is not enclosed between single quotes.
  
Unlike the SELECT clause, the WHERE clause on the UPDATE statement can only filter primary keys.
  
### DELETE

Deletes a set of records from the specified table.

```SQL
DELETE FROM Persons Where StudentID = 20525;
```

Just like in an UPDATE operation, the WHERE clause can only filter primary keys.
If the WHERE clause is absent, all the records in the table are deleted.


### TRANSACTION

Just like in SQL, AQL allows to execute a set of queries inside a transaction.
```SQL
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
query_1;
query_2;
...
query_n;
[ COMMIT | ROLLBACK ] TRANSACTION;
```

At the end, the transaction can be committed or aborted.
An ongoing transaction must always be terminated first before starting a new one.
